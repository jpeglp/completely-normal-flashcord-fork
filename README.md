#  This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.

#  Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**

[Instructions about anything and everything on Flashcord is available here.](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki)

Flashcord is currently in Beta, expect lots of things to change and quickly! Next major version will be Flashcord Gamma, set to release in 2024 if everything goes according to plan.

Check out Flashcord's LPM Branch, aka [Flashcord for Low-End Systems](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-LPM), an extremely debloated version that only keeps the essential features and primordial QoL changes.
